# AppImage-Install
Script to install AppImages

usage: 

`./appimage-install.sh  ~/Downloads/my-appimage.AppImage"`

---

## NOTE

This script will install AppImages to ~/Applications.

It will add an entry to the gnome applications menu along with the app icon.

This has been tested on Pop!OS 22.04, and Fedora 38.

I assume it will work on other Ubuntu derivatives and any desktop Gnome... open an issue if it doesn't work on an OS or DE you care about.

Or feel free to submit a PR.
